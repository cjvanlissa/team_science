1. Team science allows scholars to provide complex solutions to large-scale public challenges. It promotes collaboration, cohesion, and knowledge exchange within organizations, increases impact, and may benefit research quality.
2. Any science team should be aware of, and reflect on how they relate to, the seven challenges of team science: diversity, knowledge integration, team size, goals, permeable boundaries, geographic dispersion, and task interdependence.

3. Team members should be able to disagree constructively in a safe, supportive context. When possible, preemptive conflict management strategies should be used; anticipating disagreements and establishing terms for their constructive resolution. When conflict does occur, reactive conflict management should focus on problem-solving and compromise.
4. When composing a team, it is crucial to weigh the benefits of *task relevant diversity* against the downsides of overcoming disciplinary, institutional, or demographic differences.
5. There should be a balanced approach to permeable team boundaries, leveraging the benefits of diverse and adaptable membership while maintaining a core of stability and security to foster team cohesion and sustained performance.
6. For all temporary team members, in particular ECR and those on temporary contracts, the balance between investments (in terms of time and effort) and rewards should be explicit and fair.
7. In order for team science to flourish, TiU must acknowledge that "excellence" does not always refer to individual performance, but may also refer to team efforts.
8. In order for team science to flourish, TiU must balance hierarchy and specialization on the one hand with collaboration and integration on the other.
9. To enact a desired culture change towards more team science, a combination of a top-down (through policy, funding opportunities, and recognition and rewards) and bottom-up (through informal networks like the Open Science Community, and social, academic, and networking events) approaches is necessary.

10. The university board should task a working group with developing and evaluating general principles and specific criteria for recognizing team science contributions, and transparently incorporate these criteria in vacancies, PT&D conversations, and tenure and promotion committees.
11. Establish grants for collaborative PhD projects on thematic topics that require interdisciplinary and inter-faculty team science.
12. Require PhD candidates to contribute to one team science project during their education.
13. Fairly and transparently credit each team member's contribution in the creation of research output.
14. Explicitly state what convention was followed to credit contributions.
15. All research output should be accompanied by a CRediT contributor taxonomy statement, unless another convention for crediting contributions takes precedence, in which case a reference should be provided to the system used.
