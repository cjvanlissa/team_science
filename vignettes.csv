Project,Goals,Team Composition,Successes,Challenges
Digitalization of Health and Wellbeing (a) [several team members] ,Establishment an interdisciplinary research program/group about digitalization of health and wellbeing.,Six assistant-professors from various schools of the university + the dean of TSHD.,"The team has built relationships, secured internal ICON funding, and made progress in defining practically achievable goals.","Establishing the team was complicated by lack of clarity about membership and functioning when members signed their contracts. The project's goals have been unclear, and attempts to clarify them are sometimes hindered. There is tension due to the hierarchical structure. This leads to an information asymmetry between leadership and members. Some members would prefer a more egalitarian peer-to-peer network. Some noted conflicts due to misalignment between team members' individual interests and the project's scope, feeling as though the group was formed more for administrative reasons than in pursuit of a shared research goal. A grant application that many team members had contributed to was shelved because the core team received ICON funding, leaving other contributors to feel passed over after investing effort."
Digitalization of Health and Wellbeing (b) [vision manager] ,"Establishing an interdisciplinary research group to collaborate with partners, exchange knowledge, create academic and societal impact, and work towards long-term improvements in mental wellbeing. ","The research team is in progress, aiming to unite all five schools at Tilburg University. Currently, TSHD, TSB, and TLS are actively engaged, while TiSEM and TST are less involved. The goal is to also eventually involve all relevant external parties, but some contracts are still being finalized.","Many want to join this open project without strict criteria, fostering interdisciplinary exchange. Partners are equal, though the core team holds more control and tasks are divided by the core team but with team memberâ€™s consent.","Participating in the research team alongside existing work is challenging due to resource constraints. Aligning goals with partners can be a challenge, but joint goal-setting based on overlapping challenges and missions seem to be successful. Age diversity exists among team members, but there's limited cultural diversity."
Brabant Study,"A large longitudinal cohort study of women, from pregnancy to 5 years postpartum. The aim is to improve mothers'/children's/partners' biopsychosocial well-being.","Collaboration between 7 departments of TSB. Currently there are 4 PhD students and 2 postdocs involved. The core research team consists of experts from various disciplines involved in perinatal well-being. The project was based on existing collaborations, and attracted new partners.", "Interdisciplinary research and high output. Collaboration is central, so data are analyzed from different perspectives. Another success is the close collaboration with midwifery practices and hospitals in the region, which helped recruit a large sample (N=2800).", "Due to the many collaborators, it is important to keep an overview so that everyone can provide equal input. This also complicates swift action and decision making."
Voting advice applications (EU funded project),"Understanding the effect of voting advice applications on the population, and society at large. ","Three universities in three different countries (NL, UK, TR). A core consortium convened a larger research team and partners. ","The project was successful: training three PhD students, collecting substantial data, and publishing papers. It had social impact through conference participation and non-academic output. The initial goal was further concretized over time. Interdisciplinary communication challenges were overcome, providing learning opportunities. The team's disciplinary and demographic diversity did not hinder collaboration.","Communication challenges arose due to team members being geographically dispersed. Phone and internet communication were perceived as less effective than in-person interaction. Scheduling conflicts and varied commitments across countries complicated collaboration. Involving companies added complexity since aligning business goals with the academic focus on publications is not always straightforward. While there was no goal misalignment, strategies to pursue those goals differed. Task interdependence occasionally caused delays, but wasn't a major issue."
ODISSEI,"This national research infrastructure supports ~300 interdisciplinary projects annually. It facilitates collaboration among social science and economic faculties in the Netherlands, removing barriers for researchers, such as connecting them with interdisciplinary expertise and data.","Every social science faculty and some economic faculties in NL, and ~80 team members working at ODISSEI. The 300 annual projects each have teams with about 1-4 team members.","The successes lie in its efficient online communication which promotes flexibility, a simplified and (disciplinary and demographically) diverse team, and a horizontal, federated structure that empowers individual researchers, fostering bottom-up innovation. The project has successfully united an interdisciplinary diverse group, enabling groundbreaking research through collaborative expertise.","Managing the complexity of diverse disciplines with distinct languages and taboos remains a challenge.  Task-interdependence requires effective communication, with regular interventions to keep team members informed and engaged. The project tries to emphasize the effort needed to avoid assumptions and maintain collaboration, as it's easy to overlook progress and responsibilities within a complex team-environment."
