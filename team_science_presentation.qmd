![](nrc_2020.png)

## Wooclap (wc)

https://app.wooclap.com/ULYBOH

* Submit one answer as a team
* Examine the scientific literature on Team Science
* Then, peer-review each other's answers to assign one point/team
    + You *can* give yourself points, but be fair!
* Determine a winner!

## Defining Team Science (wc) {.smaller}

> **Team Science**: research conducted interdependently by multiple individuals (Cooke, Hilton, & Council, 2015).

- Often, but not always, interdisciplinary
- Essential for solving multifaceted challenges like climate change, inequality, and health (psychosocial determinants) (Ledford, 2015; Korthals Altes, 2014)

> **Revised definition:**
> 
>  - Collaboration with more partners than typical in a field
>  - Focus on goals beyond individual achievement
>  - Emphasizes diverse perspectives and stakeholder inclusion  
  
**Who has participated in *team science*?**

## Team Science Benefits (wc) {.smaller}

- **Impact**: Address major social, economic, and ecological challenges (Allen & Mehler, 2019; Cannon, 2020).
- **Strength-based collaboration**: specialization allows team members to contribute what comes easier to them (writing, data collection, public engagement)
- **Pool Resources**: increased statistical power (Klein et al., 2014), replication, costly data (fMRI), compute
- **Creativity, Insight, and Diverse Perspectives** (Cannon, 2020).
- **Career advantages**: Team publications have a citation advantage, particularly valuable for early career scholars (Wuchty, Jones, & Uzzi, 2007).
- **Well-being**: community and empowerment researchers (Mydin et al., 2021).
- **Mentorship**: Teams facilitate mentoring and skills transfer
- **Research **: Collaboration enhances the reproducibility and trustworthiness of research.

## Challenges of Team Science {.smaller}

- **Social Loafing** (Simms & Nichols, 2014)
- **Self Bias**: Everyone feels like they contributed most (Johnston & Miles, 2010)
- **Interdependence**: Success depends on others (Conn et al., 2019)
- **Coordination** (Forscher et al., 2023)
- **Diversity perspectives**: promote innovation but raise communication barriers (Nielsen et al., 2017)
- **Knowledge integration**: is not automatic, TMSR CoDa (Conn et al., 2019).
- **Team size paradox**: Smaller teams coordinate better, larger teams have more impact (Cummings, 2018)
- **Misaligned goals** between team members and external partners (Patel et al., 2021).
- **Physical distance**: better since COVID, but RSM strategy (Earley & Mosakowski, 2000)
- **Start-up costs**: building relationships, establishing modus operandi
- **Hard to get funded** (Bromham et al., 2016)



## Team Science and Open Science {.smaller}

**Open science *greases the wheels* of team science.**

> UNESCO: open science [comprises] practices aiming to make scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community.

FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable

* First with your (future) self
* Then with colleague next door, supervisor, co-author
* Then with larger teams
* Then with the world!
* Reducing onboarding time, improving scalability

## Specific Open Science Practices {.smaller}

* **Open/reproducible code**:
    * Increases reusability of team members' contributions [(Van Lissa et al., 2021)](https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds210031)
    * Increases rigor (easier to check and replicate work)
    * Reduces onboarding and improves scalability (Baumgartner et al. 2023)
* **Public Engagement** dimension of OS intersects with team science
    * Add perspectives, increase relevance for stakeholders (Tebes and Thai 2018)
* **Preregistration**: outline scope of work and prevents post-hoc disagreements [(Peikert, Van Lissa, and Brandmaier 2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-8611/3/4/53)
* **Registered Reports**: “guaranteed payoff” for team efforts (Baumgartner et al. 2023)
* **Open access** makes output accessible to wider audience
    * Not all stakeholders may have access to certain outlets
    * Ensure that all who have contributed retain access


<!-- ## Team Effectiveness -->

<!-- > **Input-Process-Output (IPO)** (McGrath, 1964) -->
<!--   - Helps understand team performance and how to optimize it. -->

<!-- - **Inputs**: Team composition, goals, and nature of the problem -->
<!-- - **Processes**: Within teams and -members -->
<!-- - **Outputs**: Aligned with task demands and team's goals and objectives -->

## What do Effective Teams Do? (wc)

- **Establish Mental Models**: Shared understanding of goals, tasks, and roles (Vogel et al., 2014)
- **Transactive Memory**: Awareness of each member’s expertise (Patel et al., 2021; Ghamgosar et al., 2023)
- **Nurture Relationships**: Linked to productivity (DeHart, 2017; Love et al., 2023)
- **Trust**: foundational for team effectiveness (Breuer et al., 2016; Bennett & Gadlin, 2014)

## Trust in Teams {.smaller}

- **Building Trust**: 
    - Clear, open communication (Conn et al., 2019)
    - Culture of Dialogue: Deep listening and active engagement (O'Rourke et al., 2023)
    - Joint identification of goals (Roelofs et al., 2019)
    - Formal agreements (Forscher et al., 2023)
    - Social activities (boulder outing)

## Trust, Ctd.

- **Procedural Fairness**: 
    - Trust takes time, less feasible for ECR
    - Transparency can mitigate the need for trust (DeHart, 2017; Breuer et al., 2016; Zajac et al., 2021)
- **Codes of Conduct**: 
    - Establish behavioral norms, social safety, and fair crediting in team projects (Baumgartner et al., 2023).
    - Can be off-the-shelf: Contributor Covenant (Ehmke, 2014)
    - Or co-created, e.g.: [CORE Lab Philosophy](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6jmhe)    


## When it Goes Wrong (wc)

- Intellectual disagreements != relational disagreements
    + They advance knowledge if managed well (Collins, 1998)
    + Adversarial collaboration (Clark & Tetlock, 2023)
- **Preventive strategies**: Train conflict resolution skills (Read et al., 2016), CoCs
- **Reactive strategies**: problem-solving, empathy (Marks et al., 2001), HR department and *confidential counsellor*

## Team Composition

**A Complex Affair**: 

- Impact on team effectiveness varies with task complexity, interdependence, and project duration (Carter et al., 2019)
- Alignment between expertise and team goals is essential, as are interpersonal factors (Twyman & Contractor, 2019)

## Team Composition and Diversity {.smaller}

- Diversity is not a matter of equity, social justice, and good employership (Kamerlin, 2020)
- **Social Safety**: increases confidence, trust, and cohesion, furthering team goals (Edmondson, 1999)

Lack of diversity **costs** teams:

* Missing out on skilled candidates
* Missing essential perspectives and knowledge
* Alienating relevant stakeholders, reduced impact (Powell, 2018)

Policy is important because natural tendency is to team up with "similar others" (Montoya and Horton 2013)

## Illustrating Lack of Diversity/Inclusivity {.smaller}

* On our "Nikolaustag", all employees receive a chocolate **caricature of a black person** in historical "page's costume" (Saint Nicholas' "helper")
* A colleague has a baby, but there are **no pumping rooms** available. Her office wall is made of glass
* A PhD student is **sexually harrassed by her professor** "I can see under your skirt when you walk down the stairs". HR starts a series of talks between the professor and PhD student, but it takes a mental toll on the student

## Diversity conclusions (wc)

- People tend to prefer being around similar others 
- Diversity can improve team effectiveness (Liu et al. 2020)
- **Benefits**: fresh perspectives, innovation, creativity (Nielsen et al., 2017)
- **Challenges**: Can increase conflict, especially in geographically or culturally diverse teams (Polzer et al., 2006)
- Task-relevant diversity is essential

## What Makes a Good Team Member? {.smaller}

Driskell et al., 2006:
  
- **Agreeableness**: Best predictor of interpersonal success
    * Interested in people, sympathise with others, make people feel at ease
- **Openness**: Flexibility is virtually universally advantageous (Hackman & Morris, 1978)
    * Opposite: stubborn, views uncertainty as a threat, low tolerance for ambiguity
- **Conscientiousness**: Mixed findings
    * hardworking, prepared, organized, meet obligations thoroughly and on-time, be reliable

## Team Fluidity and Permeable Boundaries {.smaller}

O'Rourke et al., 2023; Mathieu et al., 2014

- **Opportunities** (Tannenbaum et al. 2012; Zajac et
al. 2021):
    - Facilitates knowledge transfer
    - Fresh perspectives and ideas (Gruenfeld et al., 2000)
    - Adapt to changing task demands (Gorman & Cooke, 2011).
- **Challenges**:
    - Overhead from onboarding (reduced by reproducibility, CoC's)
    - Weakens team cohesion and stability (Emich et al., 2022).
    - ECRs risk contributing without sufficient recognition (Craig, 2018)
        * Example: PhD's in physics
  
## Leadership in Team Science {.smaller}

- **University Hierarchies**:
    - Structured, distinct roles and organizational units
    - Facilitates logistics but hinders innovation and collaboration (Keum & See, 2017)
- **Flexible Hierarchies** better suited to (team) science (Burns and Stalker 1994)
- **Shared Leadership** enhances team performance (Marlow et al., 2018)
  - Distributed leadership promotes collaboration and shared vision (Rycroft-Malone et al., 2016).

## Team Science and Physical Space

<font size = 6>

- **Proximity Promotes Interaction**:
    - Shared spaces can foster new connections, trust, and collaboration (Cooke et al., 2015)
    - Even brief periods of co-location can lead to new partnerships (Boudreau et al., 2012)
        * Heater not working
- **Strategic Movement**:
    - ECR can take initiative to place themselves in environments where new connections might form
    - Join events like this, use shared spaces, negotiate weekly coworking with collaborators, exchanges
    - ECR is a time to *explore* many collaborative opportunities

</font>

## Recognition and Rewards

<font size = 6>

- Dominant paradigm: "Tenure first, interdisciplinarity later,"  "Individual reputation first, collaboration later" (Klein et al., 2013)
- R&R is the **Engine of Cultural Change**:
    - R&R can foster a **collaborative and interdisciplinary environment** (Brody et al., 2019)
    - Explicit valuation in **hiring, review, and promotion** decisions (Meurer et al., 2023)
- **For Early-Career Researchers**:
    - Incentives in terms of future employment, advancement, and funding opportunities (DeHart, 2017)
    - **Doctoral Socialization** by supervisors (Austin, 2011).
- Good example: *Mildred Scheel Early Career Center* encouraging joint clinical/medical/academic collaboration, modeling team science

</font> 

## How to Credit Contributions

- **Fair and Transparent Acknowledgment** respecting disciplinary differences (Tscharntke et al., 2007; Cooke et al., 2015)
- **Contributorship Model**: Explicitly acknowledge contributions rather than relying on implicit indicators ike authorship order (Brand et al., 2015)
- State the **convention used** for attribution
- **CRediT Contributor Taxonomy**: clarify contributions along 14 dimensions (Allen et al., 2014)
- **Anonymous Attribution**: maintain fairness and social saftely in groups with power imbalances or risks of nepotism


## COARA incentivizes Team Science

*Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment*

Mildred Scheel Nachwuchszentrum could [sign COARA](https://coara.eu/)

- Away from **Metrics with Poor Validity** (Journal Impact Factor)
- Towards R&R of **Quality and Contribution**
- Assess activities essential to team science, e.g. collaboration, team science, interdisciplinarity, impact, open science practices
- Provides security for ECRs who commit to team science, and attracts suitable candidates

## Conclusions for ECRs {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Team Science isn't everything

* Not suitable for all types of work
* Not compatible with all personalites
