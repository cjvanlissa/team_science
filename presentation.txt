## Defining Team Science

> **Team Science**: collaborative mode of research involving multiple individuals working interdependently (Cooke, Hilton, & Council, 2015)

- **Size**:
  - Small teams (2-10 individuals): Agile, disruptive innovative
  - Large teams (100+, 1000+): High impact, consolidated structure (Wu, Wang, & Evans, 2019)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Division of labor and coordination in large teams
  - Team science != interdisciplinary science, though often related
- **Importance**: Essential for solving multifaceted challenges like climate change, inequality, and health (psychosocial determinants) (Ledford, 2015; Korthals Altes, 2014)

> **Revised definition:**
>   - Collaboration with more partners than typical in a field
>  - Focus on goals beyond individual achievement
>  - Emphasizes diverse perspectives and stakeholder inclusion
